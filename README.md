# Machine-Learning-
A collection of machine learning models trained using algorithms like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and regression. Each model is saved in deployable formats for quick prediction and reuse. The repository helps track learning progress and supports experimentation, evaluation, and easy integration into Flask or other applications.
